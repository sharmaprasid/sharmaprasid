    <p><strong>Birth name&nbsp;:</strong>&nbsp;Namgyal Wangdir</p>

        It is not known exactly when, how, or under what conditions the young Namgyal Wangdi came to live in the Khumbu
        region of Nepal (near Everest), nor is it known when he took the name Tenzing Norgay. Among the ethnic Sherpas,
        immigrant Tibetans such as Tenzing are known as Khambas and have low status and little or no wealth. Tenzing
        worked for several years for an affluent family in Khumjung, and, as a teen, he ran away from difficult
        conditions and settled in Darjeeling, West Bengal, India. At age 19, having married a Sherpa, he was chosen as a
        porter for his first expedition; in 1935 he accompanied Eric Shiptonâ€™s reconnaissance expedition of Everest. In
        the next few years he took part in more Everest expeditions than any other climber.
